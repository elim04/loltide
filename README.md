# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. 

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @elim04/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@username/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

* `function7(findKey)`: finds a specific key in an object
* `function8(findKeyByValue)`: finds a key with specific value in an object
* `function9(flatten)`: turns nested arrays into one array
* `function10(head)`: returns the 0 index of an array
* `function11(letterPositions)`: determines the letter position (index) of each letter in a string
* `function12(map)`: modfiys each item of an array and returns that array with new values
* `function13(middle)`: returns the middle of an array
